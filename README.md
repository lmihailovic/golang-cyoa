This was a short and sweet project, and I really enjoyed writing it. It builds
nicely over the material and concepts utilised in the previous two projects.

Also, it felt really great becoming comfortable with `http.ServeMux`,
`http.HandleFunc`, and the `html/template` library, as I have a sense I'll
need to leverage those to a hefty degree for my thesis which I am writing.

## Arguments
```
-cli
        show story in terminal
-f string
        path to story file (default "gopher.json")
```

## Bonus
- [x] Create a command-line version of our Choose Your Own Adventure application
where stories are printed out to the terminal and options are picked via typing
in numbers ("Press 1 to venture ...").
