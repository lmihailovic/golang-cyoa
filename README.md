# Choose your own adventure
This was a short and sweet project, and I really enjoyed writing it. It builds
nicely over the material and concepts utilised in the previous two projects.

Also, it felt really great becoming comfortable with `http.ServeMux`,
`http.HandleFunc`, and the `html/template` library, as I have a sense I'll
need to leverage those to a hefty degree for my thesis which I am writing.

## Bonus
- [ ] Create a command-line version of our Choose Your Own Adventure application
where stories are printed out to the terminal and options are picked via typing
in numbers ("Press 1 to venture ..."). 
- [ ] Consider how you would alter your program in order to support stories
starting form a story-defined arc. That is, what if all stories didn't start
on an arc named intro? How would you redesign your program or restructure
the JSON? This bonus exercises is meant to be as much of a thought exercise
as an actual coding one.
